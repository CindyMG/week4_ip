## E-Car Data Analysis

### Description of the project

E-Car is an electric car-sharing service company based in the city of Paris in France. For years, this company has been providing shared electric cars, known as Blue cars, which the residents of Paris are free to use or rent out at any time of day to facilitate their daily activities. E-Car has without a doubt proven to the world to be one of the best, if not the best, electric car servicing companies. In addition to directing the worldâ€™s attention away from the use of fuel-driven cars which only cause air pollution and increase global warming, E-Car has also massively aided the population of Paris by providing fast, efficient, and environmentally friendly cars to conduct their daily activities.

As exceptional as the company is in terms of servicing electric cars for the public, there is always room for improvement and E-Car would love to do just that; improve its client service. As a data scientist here at E-Car, my team has been tasked with collecting, cleaning, and analyzing all possible datasets concerning client use of the Blue cars. In this way, we will be able to clearly identify the most popular hours of the day in which the Blue cars are picked up to ensure that that time is prioritized and that there is always an abundant number of Blue cars then. This will be done with the objective of improving our services to our Parisian clientele hence boosting company profits.

#### Datasets used

In this project, I have an Autolib dataset which I cleaned and analysed to give me the specific data outcomes I intented to see.
